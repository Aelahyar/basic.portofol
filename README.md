### Personal Portofolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This is a personal website that highlights my educational background, services/skills, client testimonials, and contact information. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my front-end development skills and create an interactive, user-friendly experience.

### Project Overview
This portfolio is designed to be a single-page application with smooth scrolling and interactive elements. It includes key sections that give visitors an overview of my qualifications, services, and how they can reach out for potential collaborations or projects.
